The steps and process of chip design are as follows:

1. Specification - like problem scoping for design
2. Architecture Design - defining and designing how the components will work together to solve the problem/ meet the specification
3. RTL (Register Transfer Level) - describes the logical functionality of the chip
4. Synthesis - RTL code converted into netlist
5. Floor Planning - intial placement of components
6. Placement and Routing - physical placement and connection on the chip
7. Physical Verification - verification of layout, cross-checking with the schematic, following DRC (Design Rule Check)
8. Timing Analysis (STA - Static Timing Analysis)
9. Extraction - removing parasitic capacitance (unwanted capacitance between circuit components)
10. Simulation - measuring the performance of the chip under various different conditions, like a test
11. Final Verification - checking if the performance complies with the original verification and design
12. Tape Out - generating the GDSII file (GDSII is nothing but a file format, like .pdf for text files)
