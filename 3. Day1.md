# Chip-Design

***Day 1:
Using Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK to understand some basic functions of the physical design process.***


*Exploring the terminal:*
**Note** - to open the terminal in Linux, shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T can be used.

*Running interactive mode and designing picorv32a:*

Now, picorv32a can be opened as a file (using *cd* command) and contents can be accessed (using *ls -ltr* command) as done previously. A file called 'runs' can be opened which has just been created as seen in the above process.

From here, the tmp file is opened using *cd*, and using *ls -ltr*, we can find a merged.lef file. Opening this with a *less* command, the output is as shown:

We can exit this and return to the original screen using the command Ctrl+Z. Here, on opening the file called 'logs', the files 'results' and 'reports' can be accessed too.

Within 'logs', opening the file 'config.tcl':

'cmds.log':

Now, to run the synthesis and find the required information, we type *run_synthesis* below the interactive OpenLANE interface (images 4 and 5). It is important to note that "package require openlane 0.9" and "prep -design picorv32a" both have to be entered for *run_synthesis* to work properly. As shown below, the synthesis output is quite large and has around 29 segments with various information. This is the end of the output -

The given assignment is to calculate the flip-flop ratio from the given data. This information can be found in the 20th segment. (Searching on Linux can be done wuth Shift+Ctrl+F). The numbers highlighted in blue show the values to be considered for this ratio calculation.

The ratio is 1613/18036 = 0.089 (approx.) As a percentage, this is represented as around 8.93. 

The final step after this is to review the results of the synthesis using a **picorv32a.synthesis.v** file that should be accessed from the **synthesis folder**.

At this point, the step of synthesis in the physical design process has been completed.
