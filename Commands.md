Important commands used for executing each step of the physical design process:

1. prep
2. run_synthesis
3. run_floorplan
4. run_placement
5. run_cts (clock tree synthesis, for timing analysis)
6. run_routing
7. run_magic (for physical verification)
8. run_magic_spice_export (for netlist generation)
9. run_magic_drc (for rule-checking the design)
10. run_netgen (for extraction)
11. run_magic_antenna_check (reliability check)

Each of these commands has a corresponding function in the physical design process which it helps with.
